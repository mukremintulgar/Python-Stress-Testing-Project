**Monte Carlo Portfolio Stress Test**
This project applies a Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate downside risk in a multi-asset portfolio. Portfolio returns are constructed using historical price data and stress scenarios are generated to estimate potential extreme losses.

Portfolio
SPY – Equities (50%)
IEF – Bonds (30%)
GLD – Gold (20%)

Method
Log return calculation
Portfolio aggregation
VaR and CVaR estimation
Monte Carlo stress testing

Python, yfinance, pandas, numpy, matplotlib** were used. Simulated return distribution and 99% stress loss estimate.
